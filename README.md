# Olympic-Medals
This Project contains two data tables related to Olympics

Athletes and Events Tables 

Athlete_ID column in Events Table and  ID Column in Athletes Table  are used to create relationship between the tables

To give an overview on how the data looks in these tables, I have used the top clause and retrieved the top 10 records from both the tables:
